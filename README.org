* Machine Learning Morse Code decoder

Automatic decoding of morse code is notoriously difficult. It works
well if there's high SNR and the morse is machine generated, but hand
generated morse often has irregularities which make decoding
difficult.

This is an experiment to see whether similar techniques to speech
recognition will work for morse code.

** generate
This is to generate the training data. Many thanks to AG1LE for this.

I have modified this to include irregularities in lengths of 'dits',
'dahs', and spaces, as humans might send.


*** TODO better corpus text
Currently this only has words.  It would be better to use something
like QSO text for more characters, and to use for training a language
model if desired.
